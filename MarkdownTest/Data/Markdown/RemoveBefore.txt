###1.?You have worked on many well known projects, but for those who don't know who you are, how would you describe yourself and what you do?###

A very lucky nerd.?To elaborate &\#8211; I'm a concept artist living in Wellington, New Zealand and have been working at Weta Workshop for nearly 12 years. I'm also a dad, a drummer and restorer/ruiner of old bicycles but no one is interested in that stuff!

###2. What was it like having your own ImagineFX feature and how was it working with arguably the most recognized digital art magazine?###

I had never read an ImagineFX before so had no idea what they were about. I've checked them out since &\#8211; what an amazing resource! I can't believe anyone needs to ask?anything?about digital techniques anymore, those magazines cover absolutely everything.?My understanding of photoshop and custom brushes is very limited so I didn't really have a lot to offer from that point of view, hopefully there was something interesting in there though. I've just finished a second feature for them that talks a bit more about design philosophy rather than technique.

###3. When you are not working on doing digital art pieces, how do you enjoy spending your free time?###

Bikes, drums and beer. Ideally I'd like to combine all three but I haven't managed to find a way to attach a snare drum to the handlebars that doesn't end up with me head-first in a ditch.

###4. What brushes do you work with and are there some you tend favoring over others?###

A hard-ish oval brush and a soft round brush with pressure controlling size and opacity. I have another dual action one but I don't really know how it works. I think people worry too much about custom brushes and stuff, I haven't really found anything like that that automatically makes my pictures look better! I reckon just make something simple and fast and put in a lot of work.

###5. There are a bunch of strong hard surface, intricate concepts in your portfolio, any tips on how you go about shading hard surface objects?###

They're much easier to paint than people! Just remember everything reflects its environment to some degree so consider where you've placed your object. A rusty, weathered surface will obviously reflect a lot less than polished chrome but it will still bounce a bit back.

###6. Where have you found your sources of inspiration recently, and how do you integrate that into your work?###

I work with a pretty inspiring bunch of people at Weta, there's so much talent and creativity here that it's actually intimidating! Not just in the design department either, the engineering and model-making, costume and 3D, there's a constant torrent of inspiration in this building. Knowing that some of your designs will be built as working, practical props forces you to think practically and consider function. The guys on the floor here will let you know pretty quickly if your drawing aint gonna work! It makes you consider your designs from the inside out.

###7. When you are working on a piece, what is your process like? Do you normally find yourself starting with sketchy line work, blocks of shapes, color, etc?###

If there's time I'll always start with pencil. That's the most fun part, even after doing this stuff for so long I really still get a lot of enjoyment out of pushing graphite into paper. I'll scan that in, or just photograph it on my phone and email it to myself if I'm feeling extra lazy, and open that sucker in photoshop. I block colours in really quickly with a multiply layer then I&\#8230;. heck, you should probably just read my ImagineFX thing! It covers everything I know about painting in photoshop, which isn't a helluva lot I'll admit.

###8. You have worked on many recent movies, but what would you say are your all time favorite movies?###

Oh that's tough! Jaws, 2001: a Space Odyssey, Drunken Master 2, Kung Fu Hustle, Akira, Santa Cruz's Streets On Fire (an old skateboarding video with the greatest soundtrack of all time), the Iron Giant, Destroy All Monsters, Hausu, Tekkon Kinkreet, Porco Rosso&\#8230;.I could list stuff all day but top of the list is probably still King Kong (1933 version)

[![77][14]][14]

###9. And what are some of your all time favorite games?###

Equally tough!?From when I was a kid at the arcades &\#8211; Time Pilot, Moon Patrol but the first game that really hooked me was Asteroids. I was too scared to play Space Invaders, that monster on the side of the cabinet creeped me out as did that descending, ominous bassline.?From the Amiga era &\#8211; the Chaos Engine, Alien Breed, Speedball 2.?Consoles &\#8211; Micro Machines, Goldeneye, Uncharted 2, the GTA series&\#8230; too many to list!

All time favourite though&\#8230; I guess the one game I've played most of my life and still play today is Tetris. It's pretty much timeless, as engaging now as when it came out.

###10. You have worked on many well known movies but was there any project you see as your favorite?###

I haven't seen Elysium yet but I hope that's gonna be pretty good, I'm still amazed I got to draw dinosaurs for King Kong but&\#8230; here's a terrible answer &\#8211; there's something I'm working on right now that I can't talk about that I think is gonna be great! It's full of \*\*\*\*\*\* and there's bit where a \*\*\*\*\* totally gets \*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\* \*\*\*\*! It's awesome!

###11. What were some hurdles you noticed going through while furthering your skills as a digital artist?###

Same as everyone else really &\#8211; terrified of showing anyone your work, being really dumb at learning new software, having biceps so large that it became difficult to draw.

[![11][17]][17]

###12. Lastly, what advice can you share to those who are aspiring to become a professional concept artist?###

Try to forget the "artist" part! You're a creative technician really, your job isn't to paint beautiful pictures. Learn to deal with rejection. Be prepared to generate a lot of variations of the same thing and then throw it all in the bin. Get fast. Learn as much as you can about how machines and muscles work. Stay positive! It's a tough balance between putting a lot of thought and care into your designs but staying detached enough to not be emotionally destroyed when your work is passed over or thrown out, if you can make it work it's a really fun job. I sure feel pretty lucky to have it!
